<h1 id="subtitle">Full Time Student vs. Full Time Employee?</h1>
<p>Many college students balance school and work in order to get a head-start on their future careers and also just essentially have money to provide for themselves. However, many choose to have part-time jobs in order to make it easier on them. However, I am part of the little percentage of students who are actually both full time employees + students. Here's a little glimpse into my crazy life and daily schedules...</p>

<h2>My current job and position</h2>
<h3>Jewel Osco (Cashier + Service Desk + Reciever)</h3>
<p>I started working for Jewel Osco back in the summer of 2019 (I will be making 2 years soon!) I started off as a bagger/cashier, you know your typical part-time, easy peasy position.</p>
<p>A couple of months later during the fall of 2020, I was promoted to service desk or as I like to call it a "mini-manager", basically carrying out administrative responsibilies and working directly under our front end manager.</p>
<p>Most recently, I was offered a positon in a completely new department! I am now training and will be becoming the reciever for my Jewel location, meaning I will be responsible for "recieving" our grocery loads and making sure that vendors are delivering and completing the store's orders promptly and accurately.</p>

<h2>My Schedule</h2>
<p>Monday-Wednesday: Entire time dedicated to school! 5 classes balanced out into 3 days.</p>
<p>Thursday-Sunday: Entire time deicated to work! 8 hour shifts sprinkled throughout, reciving shifts usually being from 4AM-12PM ( EW. I know :( ) and my manager shifts being random, whenever I am needed.)</p>
<p>On average, making my "work week" anywhere from 38-45 hours.</p>

<h2>Working full-time during COVID</h2>
<p>With all of this being said, I have been blessed to have had continous employment during COVID, and while it can be a little scary, I am glad I was able to keep working as many people's jobs were affected due to the pandemic. Here's a little video that was shot for our company duing COVID-19, it was actually shot at my location and I think it's really cool, thought I would share. I thank Jewel Osco for letting me be part of their company and allowing me to have all of these opportunies.</p>
